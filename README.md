**Facestamp** is an open-source project for doing self-reference proactive deepfake defense
for accurately verifying whether an image has been manipulated.

It is able to defend against deepfakes across three deep- fake models, showing promising performance in two popular datasets and
is more robust to common post-processing image operations compared to existing methods.
