**Facestamp** is an open-source project for self-referential proactive deepfake detection, designed to accurately verify whether an image has been manipulated by a deepfake model.

It effectively defends against deepfakes generated by three different models, demonstrating strong performance on two popular datasets. Additionally, **Facestamp** is more robust to common post-processing operations compared to existing methods.
